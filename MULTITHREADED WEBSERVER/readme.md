## 🌟 Introduction

The **Multithreaded Web Server** project demonstrates a basic web server implementation in Java that handles multiple client requests simultaneously using multithreading. This project is an excellent example of concurrent programming and network communication in Java.

## 🚀 Features

- Handles multiple client connections concurrently
- Supports HTTP GET requests
- Simple and modular design
- Easy to extend and customize

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KunjShah95/JAVA-projects.git
    cd JAVA-projects/MULTITHREADED WEBSERVER
    ```

2. **Compile the code:**
    ```sh
    javac *.java
    ```

3. **Run the server:**
    ```sh
    java WebServer
    ```

## 📖 Usage

Once the server is running, you can connect to it using a web browser or any HTTP client tool (e.g., `curl`, `Postman`). The server listens on port 8080 by default but can be configured to use a different port.

### Example

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see a response from your web server.
