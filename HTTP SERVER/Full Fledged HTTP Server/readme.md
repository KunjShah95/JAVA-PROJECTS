1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/full-fledged-http-server.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

### Usage

1. Run the server:

## Configuration

The server can be configured using the `config.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Here is an example configuration:

```properties
server.port=8080
In HTTP, the Connection: close header is used to indicate that the server will close the connection after sending the response. This is often used in situations where the server doesn't expect the client to send additional requests over the same connection.
